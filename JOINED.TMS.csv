Women celebrating the ancient Greek festival honoring Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility, wore Chaste Tree blossoms as adornment. In ancient Rome, virgins carried twigs as a symbol of chastity. Medieval monks used potions of the berries to help maintain their vows of chastity.  The fruit of this tree has also been used as an herbal remedy for gynecological problems and PMS, and to increase milk production in new mothers.
